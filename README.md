# simple-sequential-scraper-tools
This repository contains a series of tools for writing simple sequential scrapers. 

That list includes a script to pull down pages, along with another one* to merge the biggest table on each page into a large, combined table.

A quick note on why some of the content in this repository is a little bit odd: I started working on these scripts the night before an MDDC talk at the University of Maryland journalism school about data-driven investigative reporting, then did most of the actual coding the next day, from a College Park restaurant with good food and no wifi. Since I didn't have access to my normal development environment, I wrote the code in PHP (which would not normally be my first choice), and I did most of my testing offline, using files that were already sitting around on the computer. So apologies for any strangeness -- I'll hopefully soon be working to clean this stuff up a bit. 





*which I believe is still incomplete at the moment -- maybe not? I forget, as it has been a little while since I last worked on this.
